		<h2>Paul McCartney</h2>
		<img src="images/mccartney.jpg" alt="" usemap="#fabfour"/>
		
		
		
<p>April 1970 Paul McCartney announced in an interview that he was to release a solo album<span class="bold"> McCartney.</span> This was seized upon by the international media as an official announcement of a Beatles breakup. McCartney was asked did he foresee a time when Lennon-McCartney would become an active songwriting partnership again?‚Äù To which he replied  he didnt think so.  </p>
<p><span class="bold">McCartney</span> was released on 17th April 1970 by Apple records. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, Linda, McCartney performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape. McCarthney recieved negative reviews, although one particular track Maybe I'm Amazed was constantly singled out for praise. It held the number 1 position for three weeks on the US Billboard Top LPs before yielding that position to Let It Be. It peaked at number 2 in Britain.</p>
<p>In May 1971 McCartney released<span class="bold"> Ram</span> accompianied by his wife Linda. Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey one of three tracks released as a single from the album went to number 1 in America. It also topped the national album charts in the UK, the Netherlands and Canada. Today, Ram is held in high regard by many music critics and is often ranked as one of McCartney's best albums. It has also been recognised as an early indie pop album. </p>
		<p>May 1973   <span class="bold">Red Rose Speedway </span> accompanied by his new band Wings was released. Give Ireland back to the Irish was the debut single but was later banned by the BBC for its political message. The group also recorded the non-album singles "Mary Had a Little Lamb", "Hi, Hi, Hi" and "Live and Let Die", the last of which was issued in June 1973. My Love was also released which topped the US Billboard Charts.    </p>
		<p><span class="bold">Band on the Run</span> was the fifth album McCartney released since leaving the Beatles. After Jet and Band on the Run were released as singles, the album became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing. It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works. 
		While recording this album in Nigeria with Denny Laine the McCartneys were robbed at knifepoint, losing a bag of song lyrics and demo tapes.The final recordings were completed in London, mostly at AIR Studios. </p>
